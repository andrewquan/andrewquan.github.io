        <p class="text-faded">Rest time is over. It's time to get to work. Now, that's the dream. The grind, the learning, the growing, the building. That's what I loveâ€”that every day I am blessed to be able to work and build my own future with my own two hands.</p>

        <p>I was a well-established Project Manager who worked alongside large automobile companies on various software projects. I began playing with code to better understand the products I was involved with, and before I knew it I had become a professional software developer.</p>

        <p>Web Development was both a natural and unnatural fit. I was already familiar with web software working in the automotive industry, but I was coming at it from a totally non-technical direction. This unique perspective helps me empathize with clients while also understanding the importance of delivering quality code.</p>
