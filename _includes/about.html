        <p class="text-faded">Rest time is over. It's time to get to work. Now, that's the dream. The grind, the learning, the growing, the building. That's what I loveâ€”that every day I am blessed to be able to work and build my own future with my own two hands.</p>

        <p>I was a well-established Project Manager who worked alongside large automobile companies. By every societal measure, I was heading towards the path to success. However, I felt that I was no longer growing and creating. My work no longer felt like mine and what I was really on the path towards was a decline into contentment.</p>

        <p>Web Development was both a natural and unnatural fit. I was already familiar with web software working in the automotive industry, but I was coming at it from a totally non-technical direction. However, what I found was that I was able to understand and value both sides of the spectrum and I know feel that gives me a unique perspective.</p>
